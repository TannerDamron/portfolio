              <h3>About Me:</h3>
              <p>I've always had a passion for developing and have been wanting to do it as my career for a long time, after learning a little bit at home I decided to attend <a href="https://www.epicodus.com"><strong>Epicodus</strong></a> in Seattle and finally make the commitment to pursuing programming full-time.</p>

            <div class="why">
              <h3>Why did I choose programming:</h3>
              <p>I chose programming because I have always wanted to be a developer, whether it would be developing apps, websites, or video games. I love the ability to start from a blank canvas and create something that you envision. I love all the miniscule details and perfectionism of programming. I also really enjoy being able to work with other people with a similar drive and love for programming.</p>
              <h3>Career Aspirations:</h3>
              <p>I would be grateful to work just about anywhere in the programming and tech industry, but one of my main aspirations would be to work in a video game studio creating a sense of wonder and imagination for the people who love to play video games.</p>
